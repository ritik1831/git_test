    Hi guys!
  </p>
  <p>
    What is your favorite branch of math? For me, it's algebraic geometry. Although it is a topic of <strong>formidable</strong> abstraction, for those willing to sit through the tomes on the subject penned by <em>Grothendieck</em>, one of the most brilliant mathematicians of the 20th century, the beauty of the subject soon becomes apparent. It is the ultimate marriage of physical and numeric intuitions, a synthesis of forms and figures, which one day may serve as the workhorse in the formulation of the next quantum leap in our understanding of physics and the universe, much like the preliminary explorations of non-Euclidean geometry by Riemann and Ricci became the all-important cornerstone of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. You can find more information on the topic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#:~:text=Algebraic%20geometry%20is%20a%20branch,about%20these%20sets%20of%20zeros.">here</a>.
